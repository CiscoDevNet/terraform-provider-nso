# nso_restconf (Resource)

Manages NSO configuration via RESTCONF calls. This resource manages part of a YANG model. It is able to read the state and therefore reconcile configuration drift.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Simple example

resource "nso_restconf" "ssh" {
  path = "tailf-ncs:ssh"
  attributes = {
    host-key-verification = "reject-unknown"
  }
}

# Define YANG lists and its elements

resource "nso_restconf" "customer" {
  path = "tailf-ncs:customers"
  lists = [
    {
      name = "customer"
      key  = "id"
      items = [
        {
          id = 123
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

# Define YANG leaf-list values

resource "nso_restconf" "device_group" {
  path = "tailf-ncs:devices/device-group=GROUP1"
  attributes = {
    name = "GROUP1"
  }
  lists = [
    {
      name   = "device-name"
      values = ["c1"]
    }
  ]
}

# Define nested attributes in YANG containers

resource "nso_restconf" "nested_attribute" {
  path   = "tailf-ncs:devices"
  delete = false
  attributes = {
    "global-settings/connect-timeout" = 25
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `path` (String) A RESTCONF path.

### Optional

- `attributes` (Map of String) Map of key-value pairs which represents the YANG leafs and its values.
- `delete` (Boolean) Delete object during destroy operation. Default value is `true`.
- `instance` (String) An instance name from the provider configuration.
- `lists` (Attributes List) YANG lists. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--lists))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The RESTCONF path.

<a id="nestedatt--lists"></a>
### Nested Schema for `lists`

Required:

- `name` (String) YANG list name.

Optional:

- `items` (List of Map of String) List of maps of key-value pairs which represents the YANG leafs and its values.
- `key` (String) YANG list key attribute. In case of multiple keys, those should be separated by a comma (`,`).
- `values` (List of String) YANG leaf-list values.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import nso_restconf.example "tailf-ncs:ssh"
```
